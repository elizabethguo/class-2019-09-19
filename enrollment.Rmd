```{r}
  x <- read_xlsx("raw-data/class_enrollment_summary_by_term_9.19.19.xlsx", skip = 3) %>% 
    clean_names() %>% 
    filter(course_department == "English") %>% 
    arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
    select(course_department, course_name, total) %>% 
    head(1)
    
```

The English class with the highest enrollment is `r x`.
